## Do these before coming to the workshop:

1) **R tutorial**: You are expected to be familiar with **R** before the workshop. If you are unfamiliar with **R**, here is a suggested tutorial and command reference. Using R installed on your computer please work through the tutorial.  

* The [GenViz Intro R tutorial](https://genviz.org/module-02-r/0002/02/01/introductionToR/) 
* The [R command cheat sheet](https://github.com/bioinformaticsdotca/bioinformaticsdotca.github.io/blob/master/resources/R_Short-refcard.pdf)

2) **Command line tutorial**: You are expected to be familiar with basic command line usage before the workshop. If you are unfamiliar with **the command line**, here is a suggested tutorial. If you have a Mac computer you can use the "Terminal" application to complete this tutorial. If you have access to a linux server at your institution you could do it there. If neither of those is available you can try a free online termline application that runs in your browser such as [COCALC](https://cocalc.com/app?anonymous=terminal).

* [UNIX Intro Tutorial](https://rnabio.org/module-00-setup/0000/06/01/Unix/)
* [Unix Cheat sheet](http://www.rain.org/~mkummel/unix.html) 

3) **Reading materials**: Please read these two articles before coming to the workshop:

* RNA-seq data fundamentals. [RNA Sequencing: The Teenage Years](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31341269/).

* RNA-seq analysis and statistics fundamentals. [RNA Sequencing Data: Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Expression Analysis](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-biodatasci-072018-021255).

Optional readings:

These are just two recently published examples that we find particularly good. We have collected a much more extensive list of resources that should be aware of below. Simply take a look at these and note for future reference.
